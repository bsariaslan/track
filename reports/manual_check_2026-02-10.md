# Manual Tracking Check

- Check performed at (UTC): 2026-02-10T13:14:00Z
- Tracking number: `00340435069707912169`

## 17Track (`17track.net` / `t.17track.net`)
- Direct automation on `17track.net` loaded the public page but did not return live results for the tracking number.
- Attempt via `t.17track.net` returned demo/sample data (`TestNumber00017`) instead of this package.
- Current result for this check: **No reliable live status captured from 17Track due to automation limitations**.

## Cainiao (`global.cainiao.com`)
- Status shown: **Delivering (1 days)**
- Origin: Mainland China
- Destination: Germany

## Comparison / discrepancy
- Cainiao returned live shipment progress.
- 17Track did not provide reliable live data in this environment during this run.
- Discrepancy: **source availability/data reliability mismatch** (not necessarily shipment mismatch).

## Status changes from previous checks
- No previous local snapshot exists in this repository, so status change comparison is **not available yet**.
